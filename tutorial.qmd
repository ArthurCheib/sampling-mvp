### **Sampling Process**

Sampling is a critical step in data collection for the Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD). It ensures that the data we gather is representative of the entire population, allowing us to draw meaningful and accurate conclusions about education policy and its effects.

### **How GEPD sampling works?**

The GEPD employs a robust two-stage sampling strategy to select schools and public officials. Initially, around 200 schools are chosen based on urban/rural classification and regions, ensuring every geographical division is accounted for. Subsequently, we randomly pick teachers and students within these schools for surveying. For public officials, a similar strategy is applied, but with a focus on different administrative levels to create a linked data chain from local to central offices.
